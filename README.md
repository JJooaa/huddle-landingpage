# Frontendmentor.io challenge 
 
[The Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0).  
[The Solution](https://huddle-landingpage-mu.vercel.app/).  

Decided to do this for fun, nothing serious happening here. I actually also recorded the makings of this page, so I will be uploading that to YouTube
sometime soon. It's a speeded up video of like 1 hour of footage compressed into 10mins. 

Techs: Vite, React, TailwindCSS.

Installation: 

```bash
yarn

and then 

yarn dev
```
